# Nest Less Code

Nest Less Code decreases your editor's font size and applies opacity to your code when you exceed the tab limits in nested code.

As you indent the code deeper, the font size gets smaller and more transparent.

## Features

### As you indent the code deeper, the font size gets smaller and more transparent.

### Don't worry! When you fix the indentation, the font size returns to normal size and opacity.
